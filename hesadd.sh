# Description: This script will take a list of user accounts to create
# as arguments. It will then iterate through the list calling hesinfo
# to get passwd file information. It then uses that information as 
# arguments for a call to the useradd program. This script has a flag 
# that specifies whether an AFS cluster home area should be used for 
# the account of if the higher speed local disks should be used. The 
# flag is set by editing the code on each server that the script is 
# installed on.


# The location of the hesinfo command.
HESINFO=/usr/bin/hesinfo

# The location of the useradd command.
USERADD=/usr/sbin/useradd

# Should the script use the users AFS cluster home directory or create
# one on the local machine?
AFS_HOME=0

# Flag for the occurrence of any errors while creating accounts
ERRORS=0

# Does the user have the Hesiod software installed?
