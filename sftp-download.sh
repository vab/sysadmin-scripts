# Description:	This script is used to download a database export backup from
#				a remote machine with sftp. An SSH keypair is used for
#				authentication. The script will copy a file with a date based
#				naming convention. It will report success or failure,
#				determined by a basic file existence check, via e-mail. This
#				script was designed to be called daily or weekly from cron.
